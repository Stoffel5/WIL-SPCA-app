                <h4>We are A PBO</h4>
                <p>Woof Woof hey there, did you know that the SPCA is a PBO (Public Benefit Organization)? Yup, it’s true! By supporting them, you’re not only helping furry pals like me find loving homes, but you’re also doing good for your community. It’s like getting belly rubs and treats—best of both worlds! So, let’s spread some love together and make the world a better place, one paw at a time! 🐾💞</p>
